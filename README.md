# Andrea Chung's Python bikeshare project
> Welcome to my bikeshare project!

### Date created
This project was created on March 23, 2019.

### Project Title
I chose the title of my project, **Andrea Chung's Python bikeshare project**, based on my desire to ensure that the instructor/mentor grading my project would not confuse my project with another student's work.  

### Description
I used Python to understand and explore bikeshare data from Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C. In my project, users choose what data they would like to see, and the results display an analysis of one of the three cities' data.

### Files used
I used the following files in my project (data files were provided by Udacity):
* chicago.csv
  * This file contained data about Chicago's bikeshare program
* new_york_city.csv
  * This file contained data about New York City's bikeshare program
* washington.csv
  * This file contained data about Washington D.C.'s bikeshare program (not to be confused with Washington state)

> I used Udacity's built-in workspace to write and run the script for this project. However, I also used Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook to run other elements of the project and course. For information on how to download and install Anaconda (which includes Jupyter Notebook) for Windows, [click here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

### Credits
I want to give a shout-out to Udacity and Udacity mentors, without whom I couldn't have completed this project.

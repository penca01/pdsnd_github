# Andrea Chung's Python bikeshare project
> Welcome to my bikeshare project!

### Date created
This project was created on March 23, 2019.

### Project Title
I chose the title of my project, **Andrea Chung's Python bikeshare project**, based on my desire to ensure that the instructor/mentor grading my project would not confuse my project with another student's work.  

### Description
I used Python to understand and explore bikeshare data from Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C. In my project, users choose what data they would like to see, and the results display an analysis of one of the three cities' data.
